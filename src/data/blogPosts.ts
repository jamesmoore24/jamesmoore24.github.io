I envision a future where education is individualized down to every single concept that a student encounters.

This means that every lesson, lecture, assignment, worksheet, test, quiz, lab and class is individualized to maximize the amount of learning in the amount of time given for education. I believe that the modern methods of education are inherently broken by misaligned incentives from government funding and bureaucratic processes within each school district down to the high school teacher that is being paid way below the value that they are providing to society. As a student at MIT I've witnessed the impact an individualized education can have on your personal education and development. I believe that AI has given us the tools to make this possible.

Here are my assumptions about people and how they learn best:

I believe that tests and fear of failure are one of the best catalysts for learning. Something that I've noticed around me at MIT is that some of the smartest people I know are constantly haunted by not being perfect. This fear combined with the hard PSETs and tests make it so that they're able to learn extremely difficult concepts within a short amount of time. This is why MIT students go on to lead and innovate within their respective fields. I don't think there is any other school whose students are more perfectionist combined with the rigor that every student must go through to graduate.
People learn when they enjoy what they're studying. Many of my classmates are experts in different subject matters because they simply WANTED to get a better understanding of the particular subject. It's interesting to see this phenomenon play out in CS social circles. It's often the case that the smartest person in the group is taking the minimal course load because it gives them extra time to build outside of school. Thus I see a lot of students at MIT adopt a min-max type of learning ability where not only are they pressured to be perfect and are afraid of failure, but they're also incentivized to learn difficult concepts as quickly as possible so they can go out and build things they actually want. By exercising this muscle they get better and better at learning new concepts in their fields of choice which make them accelerate quickly.
People learn when there's social pressure. I think this is probably one of the most potent factors that go into learning something. There has to be some social ramification to failing whether it be your parents being disappointed in you, your social circle looking down on you or whatever. There must be something at stake otherwise there isn't much reason to do anything at all. Putting students in virtual environments where this happens would greatly accelerate the pace of learning for anyone. The closest thing to a virtual environment would be some sort of group based on skill level in a particular area like a clan in Clash of Clans. I guess that there's discords out there for people that are into different games but I don't see this a lot for learning. Maybe there's something here.
People learn when they realize the importance of learning towards their goal. It is widely known that pre-meds are some of the hardest working undergraduates within their courses. This is because their GPA is directly tied to which medical school they get into which determines what kind of doctor they end up becoming. Some similar themes I've seen amongst some of the most successful people around me have been that they've had a particular goal for a long time their lives and they try maximally hard in the certain areas in their life which are directly related to their goal. If we can somehow set children up with goals from the start and then somehow tie different parts of education to a tangible outcome then I believe that they will be more willing to learn and perform.
It is REALLY important for an AI platform like this to exist. When you're young your brain is more plastic which means it is able to learn new information easier. The earlier you can teach children basic concepts in any field the more time they can spend at the cutting edge of their field innovating and benefitting society. This is triply important because the amount of knowledge required to become an expert will exponentially increase as the access to information becomes easier than ever. If we ever hope to accelerate and hit escape velocity as a society then we need an education system which gives every student an equal chance by allowing them to learn the maximal amount in the least amount of time.

Right now we have no chance at this future. Our current public education system is outdated and outright harmful to students. Curriculum is uninteresting and isn't tailored to the interests of any student. If I remember correctly the USA ranks behind other developed nations in STEM subjects by a large margin. This shouldn't be the case for the most advanced country in the world. If we have any shot of retaining our position as a world power our education system must improve tenfold.

People may read this and think: "Well education platforms like Khan Academy exist so why does there need to be another platform." I don't believe Khan Academy is doing the correct job. Learning is a serious pursuit, not a free one. There MUST be something at stake in order to learn efficiently. I believe that parents would pay a lot of money for a platform that could guarantee that their kid could become subject matter experts in whatever they're interested in by the time they were - say - 10 years old. I know this is possible because a lot of students at MIT that are at the top of the class are homeschooled. If we could make something like this and integrate it into a public school setting then I believe that we would be creating the next generation of students that would be able to lead a country that will be faced with serious and difficult developing issues over the coming decades.

I think another reason why the education system is broken is because lectures are an outdated method of learning material. As I type this the most advanced reasoning AI model is capable of solving and answering PhD level questions with remarkable accuracy. I don't think we can say the same about all public education teachers. Thus I see physical teachers in the future taking an administrative, organizational and emotional regulation roles rather as the source of knowledge. Via an intelligent platform you can see in real time what kind of learning works best for each student: hands-on, visual, auditory, etc.. and now there are various techniques for integrating LLMs into every type of learning style (videos, agents, text-to-speech).

So what does a platform and education ecosystem that does this look like and how can we build specifically to harness the growing power of AI and make the bet that these AI systems are going to get more powerful in every way?

Firstly I am a firm believer that kids must be around other kids of their age for a majority of their day. It is important for children to develop the social skills needed to be able to influence and change the world meaningfully and effectively. In the future I believe that technology will help enhance communication so it is even more important for students to be highly educated since the speed of information delivery will accelerate and thus the spread of knowledge will accelerate as well.

However what must change is how students actually learn new material. This MUST be done using AI and monitoring in order to be truly effective. Relying on teachers that may make mistakes or not know critical details about the lesson for that day cannot happen. Therefore a new generation learning platform must be built in order to effectively catalyze the learning process. It does this in a few ways:

- **Everyone feels like they are the captain of their own learning journey.** We must design the platform in a way such that each student believes that they are at the forefront of their own journey in education so that they never associate labels like "smart" or "dumb" to themselves or anyone around them. It has been shown that when a kid gets labeled as "smart" or "dumb" it effectively prohibits their excitement for learning so it is paramount that every kid feel adequate and challenged by the material that they learn.
- **Student profiling:** There must be a student profile for every student which effectively analyzes their learning habits, test scores, progress and all available information. This could be used to administer tests to classes such that it is deemed that they get a certain average (using AI agents to "take" the test with the abilities of each relative student) and to assign them to classes (kinesthetic classes) that would help them learn best based on what they're interested in and how they learn best. This would make their K-12 education experience trackable and would improve the overall system over time as more students go through the program.
- **Disruption in EdTech:** I'm willing to bet that major players in the EdTech space aren't willing to innovate at all. It is a space that needs disruption and we feel that with the new administration we would be able to take a shot at changing education forever.

I think my entire life I didn't really fit into a group. I don't know why exactly but I've always felt fundamentally different from the people who have surrounded me. I've always had extreme expectations for myself and what I believed I could do for the world. When I was in 4th grade our class was doing a career exploration activity and I happened to stumble upon the word "entrepreneur" somehow. After trying to spell it multiple times I remember telling my teacher that this was what I wanted to be when I grew up. I remember her surprised expression followed by a "you do know that is going to be hard right? Not everyone can be an entrepreneur." Those words stuck with me for a while. Did I have what it took to be one? Could I leave a lasting mark on the world? Could I somehow shape the way other people live their lives?

I remember pondering these questions and then deciding that I was going to do everything in my power to give myself the abilities to try and make the world better as I see it. I wasn't really scared of how "hard" it was going to be since I believed that the reward of being able to improve society was far greater than any individual strife that I could face. Besides, what is the point of life if not to make it better for those that come after me?

This thinking got me into the best school in the world, MIT. For the first time in my life I was surrounded by people who thought as big as me. I was ecstatic.

Around the middle of my sophomore year was when AI started to become incredibly powerful. Scaling laws guaranteed that each iteration of the new GPT model would get increasingly intelligent and there was real potential to innovate in practically every industry. I knew that this would be one of my only shots at making my dream become a reality for a couple of reasons:

1) I'm still enrolled at MIT which gives me two major advantages over any other regular founder who decides to start their own company: access to funding and infinite free time. I could purposely take easy classes to lighten my schedule which would give me more time to research and build products.
2) We're still very early in AI. I don't think people realize how powerful this technology is going to become and how the applications of AI will continue to evolve and shape the fabric of reality. Almost every industry has an AI use application (trust me I did the research here) which means in time almost everything that we see now will be integrated with AI in some way. It will essentially be the only way to stay competitive as an enterprise. Because of this disruption and the fact that I'm still early means that there are systems that are ready to change and I have to be the one to make that happen. If I took a regular SWE job I think both my bargaining power as a founder would be greatly diminished and by the time I'm able to leave the company it will be too late to truly innovate in the application space of AI.

After realizing this I started to work harder than ever before. I loved the feeling of being able to work on something over which I have full control that could potentially give me outsized returns based solely on the decisions I make. But I realized something else. I could not do this alone. Enter Casey.

Casey has been my friend ever since I came to MIT. Ever since I've known him he's always been positive and enthusiastic even in the face of injuries that kept him from playing baseball all four years during his time at MIT. He is fundamentally different from any other person I know and a true 1 of 1 person. It's because of this enthusiasm and his excellent strategic thinking ability that I'm proud to call him my co-founder and CEO. I'm also glad to say that so far the choice to include him in the venture has been a success. He wants to make his mark on the world just as much as I do.

I'm excited to see where this venture takes us.

    title: "Understanding Hashing in Backend Systems",
    date: "2024-09-21",
    excerpt:
      "An in-depth exploration of hashing strategies and their impact on API and backend system performance.",
    readTime: "6 min read",
    content: `
I reviewed the world of hashing today and I must say that from the perspective of someone who is looking to improve the latencies of different API and backend systems getting to understand the mathematical frameworks that go into evaluating different hashing strategies was fascinating. Hashing deals with trying to reduce the asymptotic runtime of an abstract data type that can:

- Insert
- Search
- Delete
- items.

We can imagine that the simplest way to do this would be just to allocate an array given some bound on the range of numbers that we are expecting to store and then just store the values inside of the table at that corresponding index. However, this is infeasible since the range of numbers can grow exponentially large and allocating those arrays in memory can be intractable. Thus, this motivates some way to maybe map the values that we're given to some constant space. This is where we get hashing.

Hashing is the action of mapping some number space \{0,..., n-1\} to a smaller number space \{0,..., m-1\} which usually means some slots in a dynamically allocated array. This can be tricky for this reason:

1. The values which we are hashing could have some intrinsic pattern to them (multiples or powers of 2, same value, etc...) which means that they could possibly be mapped to the same value in \{0,..., m-1\}
2. This raises the question of how can we guarantee that we minimize the number of collisions that happen in the table? Also, how do we deal with collisions when they occur? It isn't like we can just give up on trying to insert a value at runtime. This introduces the first couple of strategies that deal with collisions:

### Chaining

Chaining is the simple strategy of just creating linked lists for every entry in the hash table so that if there's ever a collision then we can just store the value within the linked list by appending it. This has an obvious issue since a malicious adversary can just pick keys that map to the same hash value which creates a chain of length O(n) and thus defeats the purpose of the hash table in the first place since it would take O(n) time to search up a value in our hash table. This motivates some other way to deal with collisions

### Open Addressing

Open addressing is the process of utilizing other empty space in the table to store values if they happen to collide. In order to do this there must be some probing sequence that effectively encodes some permutation of <0,..., m-1> so that every spot in the table is checked once. The idea is that if we see another element stored at some spot inside of the hash table then we just check the next index inside of the probing sequence at that index in the hash table. To search for elements we would calculate its probing sequence and then try and search for the element. If at some point we come across an empty index and we still haven't found the element than it is safe to assume that the element does not exist in the hash table. The easiest way to do this would be to linearly probe through the array and then wrap around but this creates "chains" of values within the table which isn't good for keys drawn from a distribution which gives high probability to keys bunched together or that follow some pattern. Another way we could design a good probing sequence is by using quadratic probing or picking some c\_1 and c\_2 such that h(k, i) = (h(k) + c\_1i + c\_2i^2) mod m. This is better but still creates these clumps which we would ideally want to get away from. The best way to approach the open addressing problem is by trying to get close to a uniform "spread" of the probing sequence. We can do this by defining two auxiliary hash functions h\_1 and h\_2. h\_1 can just be our regular hash function but it is important that h\_2 maps to a number that is coprime or relatively prime to m. Here is why it is important. We are looking to generate a probing sequence that is some permutation of <0,..., m-1> and this is only possible due to the coprime property that states that if two numbers say a, b are coprime than their ax = 1 mod b which means that a has a multiplicative inverse mod b. This means that for some c ∈ 0, 1,..., m-1 if we do ac mod b then the residuals will map to that permutation of <0,..., m-1>. We observe that this c is in fact i in the original equation so our constraints are satisfied for the hashing function. Open addressing, however, suffers from managing deletions as you can imagine that deleting an element would cause searching for other elements to incorrectly terminate thinking that the element isn't there when actually another element that was taking the space was just deleted. We can assign "tombstone" markers onto different indices within the table so that search can pass over them. However, this limits the provable guarantee that the search time is O(1) and related to just the load factor so chaining is used often when deletions must be made.

### Universal Hashing

Even with these two strategies because our hashing functions are deterministic we don't have the ability to protect against a malicious adversary who is looking to map our keys to similar values. To do this we must randomize the selection of a hash function from a family of hash functions that in expectation provide us with the simple uniform hashing assumption. A good hashing family would be h\_{a, b}(k) = ((ak + b) mod p) mod m such that if we choose a in \{1,..., m-1\} and b in \{0, 1,..., m-1\} then we are guaranteed to get that the probability of two keys colliding in expectation is 1/m if the a and b are chosen randomly.

This is both a provable and powerful result. Since we can guarantee that in expectation that the probability that two keys mapping to the same hash value is 1/m regardless of the distribution and sampling method that produced these keys we know that we can both search and delete in expected and amortized O(1) time.

    title: "Why Personal Websites Matter in the Age of Social Media",

    excerpt:
      "Exploring the importance of maintaining a personal website amidst the proliferation of specialized social platforms.",
    readTime: "5 min read",
    content: `
I guess the reason why I wanted to make a personal website wasn't entirely just because I thought it might be nice to have one. I actually think there's a genuine issue with how there exist multiple apps and places where we effectively host our personas on. Like how LinkedIn is for our "professional" side, Instagram/FB(if you're older) is for our "rich/successful/cool trips and showing off" side and Twitter/X is for more of our intellectual and argumentative/opinionated side. There of course are other examples of platforms which essentially take in different personas and interests but it begs the question of why there can't be one site or application that hosts all that we need?

I guess the obvious answer is that the task of building such a website/application is such a challenge that we simply don't have the technology to support such an endeavor. I think the fact that X is currently attempting to be the "Everything app" confirms this belief but I can't help but theorize that it is just the way that we humans like to organize our different personas and interests into buckets. Like if I log into Instagram I have a certain attitude and thing that I'm looking for compared to when, say, I log into X or LinkedIn. Like a specific subconscious mindset is activated which locks me into a certain thought process when I enter a certain app. The problem with doing this is that I don't believe you are representing the fullness of your being as a human when you engage with these applications. This is problematic because if we're not authentically representing ourselves then we leave connection, employment and discourse opportunities on the table all of which improve the human condition.

This is in fact why I think something like a personal website built from scratch is important to have. It essentially frees anyone from the algorithmic confines that any consumer application like Facebook, Instagram or Twitter tries to impose on you. Here I have to say that I believe Twitter does a better job at letting users understand exactly what is in the algorithm which is really cool and is why I only have Twitter (except for LinkedIn because I want to be employed but even Twitter is starting to allow the ability to post and look for jobs so I might delete it in the future if it is comprehensive enough).

I hope the future of the website looks like something that accurately represents and logs my beliefs, big or small, over the course of some significant amount of time. If all else fails at least I'll have a way for people to contact me and see what I'm up to.
