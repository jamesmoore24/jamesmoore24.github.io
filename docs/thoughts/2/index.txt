c:["$","p",null,{"className":"leading-relaxed text-gray-700","children":"This might be an underrated reason for deep work. I think having a tight feedback loop between input and output is critical to sustaining focus for long periods of time. In a way, being able to work fast gives you a feeling of control over your machine (in a non-maniacal way I promise) which makes you feel really good! This means learning key binds for common operations (yes I'm talking about vim) as they allow you to shorten the time between idea and execution. Every second of delay between those two results in fatigue and forgetting which is catastrophic when you're trying to set up important experiments, analyze data and generate hypotheses. In a way, you're always fighting against forgetting crucial ideas and insights which means that speed is the only way to counteract this force."}]
