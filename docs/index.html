                <p>The purpose of these blog posts is to document my life so I can look back on my different perspectives and how they've influenced the graph of my life and what decisions I've made. I hope by actively contributing to these blog posts I can get a better understanding of myself and the world. My goal is to never let my priors go to zero and to always be constantly updating my beliefs :) </p>

                    <h2>Making my personal website (8/23/2024)</h2>
                    <p>I guess the reason why I wanted to make a personal website wasn't entirely just because I thought it might be nice to have one. I actually think there's a genuine issue with how there exist multiple apps and places where we effectively host our personas on. Like how LinkedIn is for our "professional" side, Instagram/FB(if you're older) is for our "rich/successful/cool trips and showing off" side and Twitter/X is for more of our intellectual and argumentative/opinionated side. There of course are other examples of platforms which essentially take in different personas and interests but it begs the question of why there can't be one site or application that hosts all that we need?</p>
                    <p>I guess the obvious answer is that the task of building such a website/application is such a challenge that we simply don't have the technology to support such an endeavor. I think the fact that X is currently attempting to be the "Everything app" confirms this belief but I can't help but theorize that it is just the way that we humans like to organize our different personas and interests into buckets. Like if I log into instagram I have a certain attitude and thing that I'm looking for compared to when, say, I log ito X or LinkedIn. Like a specific subconscious mindset is activated which locks me into a certain thought process when I enter a certain app. The <b>problem</b> with doing this is that I don't believe you are representing the full-ness of your being as a human when you engage with these applications. This is problematic because if we're not authentically representing ourselves then we leave connection, employment and discourse opoortunities on the table all of which improve the human condition.</p>
                    <p>This is in fact why I think something like a personal website built from scratch is important to have. It essentially frees anyone from the algorithmic confines that any consumer application like Facebook, Instgram or Twitter tries to impose on you. Here I have to say that I believe Twitter does a better job at letting users understand <a href="https://github.com/twitter/the-algorithm">exactly what is in the algorithm</a> which is really cool and is why I only have Twitter (except for LinkedIn because I want to be employed but even Twitter is starting to allow the ability to post and look for jobs so I might delete it in the future if it is comprehensive enough). </p>
                    <p>I hope the future of the website looks like something that accurately represents and logs my beliefs, big or small, over the course of some significant amount of time. If all else fails at least I'll have a way for people to contact me and see what I'm up to.</p>
