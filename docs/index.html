                  <b>What I learned:</b><br /><br />
                  FitLink was developed as part of MIT's annual IAP "Web Lab"
                  programming competition. This was truly my first real
                  long-term hacking experience and I went really deep into
                  full-stack development. I went into the project with a very
                  surface level understanding of HTML/CSS, JavaScript and web
                  development in general and I came out of the project with the
                  ability to create any full-stack application that I want. I'm
                  proud of this project and had plans to scale the platform but
                  those plans took a backseat to my baseball season and other
                  classes. At a higher level I learned the importance of good
                  initial software design and abstraction since dealing with a
                  increasingly larger project becomes unwieldly and I soon found
                  myself spending more and more time refactoring old code than
                  actually engineering new features which is suboptimal.

              This project was completed as part of 6.8301 Advances in Computer
              Vision and was more of a deep dive into ResNets and trying to see
              if we could fine-tune one to control their output for a specific
              use case. Our group decided that the generation of x-rays based
              off of a pose sketch (similar to the ones in
              <a href="https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose"
                >OpenPose</a

              patient care. I led the technical development of the data
              preprocessing and model training pipelines and eventually trained
              our model to be 7% better than SotA. Got very comfortable with
              PyTorch and hacking a model to make it work better by adjusting
              the structure, hyperparams and data.

                <b>What I learned:</b><br /><br />
                This was a very insightful project into the world of ML. It was
                my first large-scale ML project and I had 2 other people on my
                team to consult and help develop the software infrastructure to
                make it work. The first thing I quickly learned what how sparse
                widely used datasets were at least when it came to medical
                imaging. The scope of our fine-tuning could only go so far as to
                what was depicted in the data set and for a lot of our potential
                use-cases there just wasn't enough high quality x-rays that fit
                the use-case. In addition, configuring environments suitable for
                ML training and preprocessing proved to be difficult and working
                on the platform without a guaranteed connection to a sustained
                runtime became extremely cumbersome. There were many instances
                where I needed to close my computer which inadvertantly ended a
                training run which eliminated my environment that I set up which
                meant redownloaded every package that I needed for the training.
                What I found interesting what the different effects of SoTA
                techinques on the performance of the model on the validation set
                and it was fun getting to do things like BatchNorm, dropout and
                early stopping during my runs.

              I wanted a comprehensive way to view different market trends for
              single and grouped stocks so I created a program that would run
              everyday and capture all of the different movement patterns of the
              different stocks in the S&P500 so I could get a general
              understanding of what was going on in the market from a
              statistical perspective. Obviously this data is widely available
              on the internet but what's different about this program is its
              extensibility. I'm able to create different metrics and criteria
              for stocks and then rank the stocks against each other based on
              that custom criteria which is something that is difficult to do on
              other visualization and backtesting platforms.

                world. When I was in 4th grade our class was doing a career
                exploration activity and I happened to stumble upon the word
                "entrepreneur" somehow. After try ing to spell it multiple times
                I remember telling my teacher that this was what I wanted to be
                when I grew up. I remember her surprised expression followed by
                a "you do know that is going to be hard right ? Not everyone can
                be an entrepreneur." Those words stuck with me for a while. Did
                I have what it took to be one? Could I leave a lasting mark on
                the world? Could I somehow shape the way other people live their
                lives?
              </p>
              <p>
                I remember pondering these questions and then deciding that I
                was going to do everything in my power to give myself the
                abilities to try and make the world better as I see it. I wasn't
                really scared of ho w "hard" it was going to be since I believed
                that the reward of being able to improve society was far greater
                than any individual strife that I could face. Besides, what is
                the point of life if not to make it better for those that come
                after me?
              </p>
              <p>
                This thinking got me into the best school in the world, MIT. For
                the first time in my life I was surrounded by people who thought
                as big as me. I was in heaven. But I quickly found out that the
                same people that preached their wildest dreams to me their
                freshman year started to narrow their focus and take internships
                and full-time offers at companies which gave them very little
                power of what they did day to day. After erroneously following
                in their footsteps I realized the mistake I was making. I would
                be wasting my prime years as a young 20 year old working a tech
                job at a FAANG company. The world deserve s better.
              </p>
              <p>
                This thinking isolated me from a lot of my peers that were set
                on working their "prestigious" jobs but realistically if I had
                any chance at impacting the lives of millions of people I
                couldn't care about what they thought of me. I would have to go
                on this journey without prompting and without any validation.
              </p>
              <p>
                It was around this time when AI started to become incredibly
                powerful. Scaling laws guaranteed that each iteration of the new
                GPT model would get increasingly intelligent and there was real
                potential to innovate in practically every industry. I knew that
                this would be one of my only shots at making my dream become a
                reality for a couple of reasons
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  1) I'm still enrolled at MIT which gives me two major
                  advantages over any other regular founder who decides to start
                  their own company. Access to funding and infinite free time. I
                  could purposely take easy classes to lighten my schedule which
                  would give me more time to research and build products. In
                  addition, by being a student I get access to all types of
                  great VC funds across Boston who give better ter ms to
                  founders out of MIT
                </li>
                <li>
                  2) We're still very early in AI. I don't think people realize
                  how powerful this technology is going to become and how the
                  applications of AI will continue to evolve and shape the
                  fabric of reality. Almost every industry has an AI use
                  application (trust me I did the research here) which means in
                  time almost everything that we see now will be integrated with
                  AI in some way. It will essentially be the only w ay to stay
                  competitive as an enterprise. Because of this disruption and
                  the fact that I'm still early means that there are systems
                  that are ready to change and I have to be the one to make that
                  happen. If I took a regular SWE job I think both my bargaining
                  power as a founder would be greatly diminished and by the time
                  I'm able to leave the company it will be too late to truly
                  innovate in the application s pace of AI.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                After realizing this I started to work harder than ever before.
                I loved the feeling of being able to work on something which I
                have full control over that could potentially give me outsized
                returns based solely on the decisions I make. But I realized
                something else. I could not do this alone. Enter Casey.
              </p>
              <p>
                Casey has been my friend ever since I came to MIT. Ever since
                I've known him he's always been positive and enthusiastic even
                in the face of injuries that kept him from playing baseball all
                four years duri ng his time at MIT. He is fundamentally
                different than any other person I know and a true 1 of 1 person.
                It's because of this enthusiasm and his excellent strategic
                thinking ability that I'm proud to call him my co-founder and
                CEO. I'm also glad to say that so far the choice to include him
                in the venture has been a success. He wants to make his mark on
                the world just as much as I do.
              </p>
              <p>
                I'm excited to see where this venture takes us. Godspeed

            <summary>My bet on education</summary>
            <div class="content">
              <p>
                I envision a future where education is individualized down to
                every single concept that a student encounters.
              </p>
              <p>
                This means that every lesson, lecture, assignment, worksheet,
                test, quiz, lab and class is individualized to maximize the
                amount of learning in the amount of time given for education. I
                believe that the modern methods of education are inherently
                broken by misaligned incentives from government funding and
                beareaucratic processes within each school district down to the
                high school teacher that is being paid way below the value that
                they are providing to society. As a student at MIT I've
                witnessed the impact an individualized education can have on
                your personal education and development. I believe that AI has
                given us the tools to make this possible.
              </p>
              <p>
                Here are my assumptions about people and how they learn best:
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  I believe that tests and fear of failure are one of the best
                  catalysts for learning. Something that I've noticed around me
                  at MIT is that some of the smartest people I know are
                  constantly haunted by not being perfect. This fear combined
                  with the hard PSETs and tests make it so that they're able to
                  learn extremely difficult concepts within a short amount of
                  time. This is why MIT students go on to lead and innovate
                  within their respective fields. I don't think there is any
                  other school whose students are more perfectionist combined
                  with the rigor that every student must go through to graduate.
                </li>
                <li>
                  People learn when they enjoy what they're studying. Many of my
                  classmates are experts in different subject matters because
                  they simply WANTED to get a better understanding of the
                  particular subject. It's interesting to see this phenomenon
                  play out in CS social circles. It's often the case that the
                  smartest person in the group is taking the minimal course laod
                  because it gives them extra time to build outside of school.
                  Thus I see a lot of students at MIT adopt a min-max type of
                  learning ability where not only are they pressured to be
                  perfect and are afraid of failure, but they're also
                  incentivized to learn difficult concepts as quickly as
                  possible so they can go out and build things they actually
                  want. By exercising this muscle they get better and better at
                  learning new concepts in their fields of choice which make
                  them accelerate quickly.
                </li>
                <li>
                  People learn when there's social pressure. I think this is
                  probably one of the most potent factors that go into learning
                  something. There has to be some social ramification to failing
                  whether it be your parents being dissapointed in you, your
                  social circle looking down on your or whatever. There must be
                  something at stake otherwise there isn't much reason to do
                  anything at all. Putting students in virtual environments
                  where this happens would greatly accelerate the pace of
                  learning for anyone. The closest thing to a virtual
                  environment would be some sort of group based on skill level
                  in a particular area like a clan in clash of clans. I guess
                  that there's discords out there for people that are into
                  different games but I don't see this a lot for learning. Maybe
                  there's something here.
                </li>
                <li>
                  People learn when they realize the importance of learning
                  towards their goal. It is widely known that pre-meds are some
                  of the hardest working undergraduates within their courses.
                  This is because their GPA is directly tied to which medical
                  school they get into which determines what kind of doctor they
                  end up becoming. Some similar themes I've seen amongst some of
                  the most successful people around me have been that they've
                  had a particular goal for a long time their lives and they try
                  maximally hard in the certain areas in their life which are
                  directly related to their goal. If we can somehow set children
                  up with goals from the start and then somehow tie different
                  parts of education to a tangible outcome then I believe that
                  they will be more willing to learn and perform.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                It is REALLY important for an AI platform like this to exist.
                When you're young your brain is more plastic which means it is
                able to learn new information easier. The earlier you can teach
                children basic concepts in any field the more time they can
                spend at the cutting edge of their field innovating and
                benefitting society. This is triply important because the amount
                of knowledge required to become an expert will exponentially
                increase as the access to information becomes easier than ever.
                If we ever hope to accelerate and hit escape velocity as a
                society then we need an education system which gives every
                student an equal chance by allowing them to learn the maximal
                amount in the least amount of time.
              </p>

              <p>
                Right now we have no chance at this future. Our current public
                education system is outdated and outright harmful to students.
                Curriculum is uninteresting and isn't tailored to the interests
                of any student. If I remember correctly the USA ranks behind
                other developed nations in STEM subjects by a large margin. This
                shouldn't be the case for the most advanced country in the
                world. If we have any shot of retaining our position as a world
                power our education system must improve tenfold.
              </p>

              <p>
                People may read this and think: "Well education platforms like
                Khan academy exist so why does there need to be another
                platform." I don't believe Khan Academy is doing the correct
                job. Learning is a serious pursuit, not a free one. There MUST
                be something at stake in order to learn efficiently. I believe
                that parents would pay a lot of money for a platform that could
                guarantee that their kid could become subject matter experts in
                whatever they're interested in by the time they were - say - 10
                years old. I know this is possible because a lot of students at
                MIT that are at the top of the class are homeschooled. If we
                could make something like this and integrate it into a public
                school setting then I believe that we would be creating the next
                generation of students that would be able to lead a country that
                will be faced with serious and difficult developing issues over
                the coming decades.
              </p>

              <p>
                I think another reason why the education system is broken is
                because lectures are an outdated method of learning material. As
                I type this the most advanced reasoning AI model is capable of
                solving and answering PhD level questions with remarkable
                accuracy. I don't think we can say the same about all public
                education teachers. Thus I see physical teachers in the future
                taking an administrative, organizational and emotional
                regulation roles rather as the source of knowledge. Via an
                intelligent platform you can see in real time what kind of
                learning works best for each student: hands-on, visual,
                auditory, etc.. and now there are various techniques for
                integrating LLMs into every type of learning style (videos,
                agents, text-to-speech).
              </p>

              <p>
                So what does a platform and education ecosystem that does this
                look like and how can we build specifically to harness the
                growing power of AI and make the bet that these AI systems are
                going to get more powerful in every way?
              </p>

              <p>
                Firstly I am a firm believer that kids must be around other kids
                of their age for a majority of their day. It is important for
                children to develop the social skills needed to be able to
                influence and change the world meaningfully and effectively. In
                the future I believe that technology will help enhance
                communication so it is even more important for students to be
                highly educated since the speed of information delivery will
                accelerate and thus the spread of knowledge will accelerate as
                well.
              </p>

              <p>
                However what must change is how students actually learn new
                material. This MUST be done using AI and monitoring in order to
                be truly effective. Relying on teachers that may make mistakes
                or not know criticial details about the lesson for that day
                cannot happen. Therefore a new generation learning platform must
                be built in order to effectively catalyze the learning process.
                It does this in a few ways:
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  Everyone feels like they are the captain of their own learning
                  journey. We must design the platform in a way such that each
                  student believes that they are at the forefront of their own
                  journey in education so that they never associate labels like
                  "smart" or "dumb" to themselves or anyone around them. It has
                  been shown that when a kid gets labeled as "smart" or "dumb"
                  it effectively prohibits their excitement for learning so it
                  is paramount that every kid feel adequate and challenged by
                  the material that they learn.
                </li>
                <li>
                  To this end there must be a student profile for every student
                  which effectively analyzes their learning habits, test scores,
                  progress and all available information. This could be used to
                  administer tests to classes such that it is deemed that they
                  get a certain average (using AI agents to "take" the test with
                  the abilities of each relative student) and to assign them to
                  classes (kinestheic classes) that would help them learn best
                  based on what their interested in and how they learn best.
                  This would make their K-12 education experience trackable and
                  would improve the overall system over time as more students go
                  through the program.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                I'm willing to bet that major players in the EdTech space aren't
                willing to innovate at all. It is a space that needs disruption

            <summary>Perfect (???) Hashing</summary>
            <div class="content">
              <p>
                I reviewed the world of hashing today and I must say that from
                the perspective of someone who is looking to improve the
                latencies of different API and backend systems getting to
                understand the mathematical frameworks that go into evaluating
                different hashing strategies was fascinating. Hashing deals with
                trying to reduce the asymptotic runtime of an abstract data type
                that can:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Insert</li>
                <li>Search</li>
                <li>Delete</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                items. We can imagine that the simplest way to do this would be
                just to allocate an array given some bound on the range of
                numbers that we are expecting to store and then just store the
                values inside of the table at that corresponding index. However
                this is infeasible since the range of numbers can grow
                exponentially large and allocating those arrays in memory can be
                intractable. Thus, this motivates some way to maybe map the
                values that we're given to some constant space. This is where we
                get hashing.
              </p>
              <p>
                Hashing is the action of mapping some number space {0,..., n-1}
                to a smaller number space {0,..., m-1} which usually means some
                slots in a dynamically allocated array. This can be tricky for
                this reason:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The values which we are hashing could have some intrinsic
                  pattern to them (multiples or powers of 2, same value, etc...)
                  which means that they could possibly be mapped to the same
                  value in {0,..., m-1}
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                This raises the question of how can we guarantee that we
                minimize the number of collisions that happen in the table?
                Also, how do we deal with collisions when they occur? It isn't
                like we can just give up on trying to insert a value at runtime.
                This introduces the first couple of strategies that deal with
                collisions:
              </p>
              <h3>Chaining</h3>
              <p>
                Chaining is the simple strategy of just creating linked lists
                for every entry in the hash table so that if there's ever a
                collision then we can just store the value within the linked
                list by appending it. This has an obvious issue since a
                malicious adversary can just pick keys that map to the same hash
                value which creates a chain of length O(n) and thus defeats the
                purpose of the hash table in the first place since it would take
                O(n) time to search up a value in our hash table. This motivates
                some other way to deal with collisions
              </p>
              <h3>Open Addressing</h3>
              <p>
                Open addressing is the process of utilizing other empty space in
                the table to store values if they happen to collide. In order to
                do this there must be some probing sequence that effectively
                encodes some permutation of <0,..., m-1> so that every spot in
                the table is checked once. The idea is that if we see another
                element stored at some spot inside of the hash table then we
                just check the next index inside of the probing sequence at that
                index in the hash table. To search for elements we would
                calculate its probing sequence and then try and search for the
                element. If at some point we come across an empty index and we
                still haven't found the element than it is safe to assume that
                the element does not exist in the hash table. The easiest way to
                do this would be to linearly probe through the array and then
                wrap around but this creates "chains" of values within the table
                which isn't good for keys drawn from a distribution which gives
                high probability to keys bunched together or that follow some
                pattern. Another way we could design a good probing sequence is
                by using quadratic probing or picking some c_1 and c_2 such that
                h(k, i) = (h(k) + c_1i + c_2i^2) mod m. This is better but still
                creates these clumps which we would ideally want to get away
                from. The best way to approach the open addressing problem is by
                trying to get close to a uniform "spread" of the probing
                sequence. We can do this by defining two auxiliary hash
                functions h_1 and h_2. h_1 can just be our regular hash function
                but it is important that h_2 maps to a number that is coprime or
                relatively prime to m. Here is why it is important. We are
                looking to generate a probing sequence that is some permutation
                of <0,..., m-1> and this is only possible due to the coprime
                property that states that if two numbers say a, b are coprime
                than their ax = 1 mod b which means that a has a multiplicative
                inverse mod b. This means that for some c âˆˆ 0, 1,..., m-1 if we
                do ac mod b then the residuals will map to that permutation of
                <0,..., m-1>. We observe that this c is in fact i in the
                original equation so our constraints are satisfied for the
                hashing function. Open addressing, however, suffers from
                managing deletions as you can imagine that deleting an element
                would cause searching for other elements to incorrectly
                terminate thinking that the element isn't there when actually
                another element that was taking the space was just deleted. We
                can assign "tombstone" markers onto different indices within the
                table so that search can pass over them. However this limits the
                provable guarantee that the search time is O(1) and related to
                just the load factor so chaining is used often when deletions
                must be made.
              </p>
              <h3>Universal Hashing</h3>
              <p>
                Even with these two strategies because our hashing functions are
                deterministic we don't have the ability to protect against a
                malicious adversary who is looking to map our keys to similar
                values. To do this we must randomized the selection of a hash
                function from a family of hash functions that in expectation
                provide us with the simple uniform hashing assumption. A good
                hashing family would be h_{a, b}(k) = ((ak + b) mod p) mod m
                such that if we choose a in {1,..., m-1} and b in {0, 1,...,
                m-1} then we are guaranteed to get that the probability of two
                keys colliding in expectation is 1/m if the a and b are chosen
                randomly.
              </p>
              <p>
                This is both a provable and powerful result. Since we can
                guarantee that in expectation that the probability that two keys
                mapping to the same hash value is 1/m regardless of the
                distribution and sampling method that produced these keys we
                know that we can both search and delete in expected and
                amortized O(1) time.

            <summary>Making my personal website</summary>
            <div class="content">
              <p>
                I guess the reason why I wanted to make a personal website
                wasn't entirely just because I thought it might be nice to have
                one. I actually think there's a genuine issue with how there
                exist multiple apps and places where we effectively host our
                personas on. Like how LinkedIn is for our "professional" side,
                Instagram/FB(if you're older) is for our "rich/successful/cool
                trips and showing off" side and Twitter/X is for more of our
                intellectual and argumentative/opinionated side. There of course
                are other examples of platforms which essentially take in
                different personas and interests but it begs the question of why
                there can't be one site or application that hosts all that we
                need?
              </p>
              <p>
                I guess the obvious answer is that the task of building such a
                website/application is such a challenge that we simply don't
                have the technology to support such an endeavor. I think the
                fact that X is currently attempting to be the "Everything app"
                confirms this belief but I can't help but theorize that it is
                just the way that we humans like to organize our different
                personas and interests into buckets. Like if I log into
                instagram I have a certain attitude and thing that I'm looking
                for compared to when, say, I log ito X or LinkedIn. Like a
                specific subconscious mindset is activated which locks me into a
                certain thought process when I enter a certain app. The
                <b>problem</b> with doing this is that I don't believe you are
                representing the full-ness of your being as a human when you
                engage with these applications. This is problematic because if
                we're not authentically representing ourselves then we leave
                connection, employment and discourse opoortunities on the table
                all of which improve the human condition.
              </p>
              <p>
                This is in fact why I think something like a personal website
                built from scratch is important to have. It essentially frees
                anyone from the algorithmic confines that any consumer
                application like Facebook, Instgram or Twitter tries to impose
                on you. Here I have to say that I believe Twitter does a better
                job at letting users understand
                <a href="https://github.com/twitter/the-algorithm"
                  >exactly what is in the algorithm</a
                >
                which is really cool and is why I only have Twitter (except for
                LinkedIn because I want to be employed but even Twitter is
                starting to allow the ability to post and look for jobs so I
                might delete it in the future if it is comprehensive enough).
              </p>
              <p>
                I hope the future of the website looks like something that
                accurately represents and logs my beliefs, big or small, over
                the course of some significant amount of time. If all else fails
                at least I'll have a way for people to contact me and see what
                I'm up to.
