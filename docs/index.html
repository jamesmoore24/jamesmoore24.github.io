                  <b>What I learned:</b><br /><br />
                  FitLink was developed as part of MIT's annual IAP "Web Lab"
                  programming competition. This was truly my first real
                  long-term hacking experience and I went really deep into
                  full-stack development. I went into the project with a very
                  surface level understanding of HTML/CSS, JavaScript and web
                  development in general and I came out of the project with the
                  ability to create any full-stack application that I want. I'm
                  proud of this project and had plans to scale the platform but
                  those plans took a backseat to my baseball season and other
                  classes. At a higher level I learned the importance of good
                  initial software design and abstraction since dealing with a
                  increasingly larger project becomes unwieldly and I soon found
                  myself spending more and more time refactoring old code than
                  actually engineering new features which is suboptimal.

              This project was completed as part of 6.8301 Advances in Computer
              Vision and was more of a deep dive into ResNets and trying to see
              if we could fine-tune one to control their output for a specific
              use case. Our group decided that the generation of x-rays based
              off of a pose sketch (similar to the ones in
              <a href="https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose"
                >OpenPose</a
              >) has some pretty useful applications with pre and post-treatment
              patient care. I led the technical development of the data
              preprocessing and model training pipelines and eventually trained
              our model to be 7% better than SotA. Got very comfortable with
              PyTorch and hacking a model to make it work better by adjusting
              the structure, hyperparams and data.

                <b>What I learned:</b><br /><br />
                This was a very insightful project into the world of ML. It was
                my first large-scale ML project and I had 2 other people on my
                team to consult and help develop the software infrastructure to
                make it work. The first thing I quickly learned what how sparse
                widely used datasets were at least when it came to medical
                imaging. The scope of our fine-tuning could only go so far as to
                what was depicted in the data set and for a lot of our potential
                use-cases there just wasn't enough high quality x-rays that fit
                the use-case. In addition, configuring environments suitable for
                ML training and preprocessing proved to be difficult and working
                on the platform without a guaranteed connection to a sustained
                runtime became extremely cumbersome. There were many instances
                where I needed to close my computer which inadvertantly ended a
                training run which eliminated my environment that I set up which
                meant redownloaded every package that I needed for the training.
                What I found interesting what the different effects of SoTA
                techinques on the performance of the model on the validation set
                and it was fun getting to do things like BatchNorm, dropout and
                early stopping during my runs.

              I wanted a comprehensive way to view different market trends for
              single and grouped stocks so I created a program that would run
              everyday and capture all of the different movement patterns of the
              different stocks in the S&P500 so I could get a general
              understanding of what was going on in the market from a
              statistical perspective. Obviously this data is widely available
              on the internet but what's different about this program is its
              extensibility. I'm able to create different metrics and criteria
              for stocks and then rank the stocks against each other based on
              that custom criteria which is something that is difficult to do on
              other visualization and backtesting platforms.

          <p>
            The purpose of these blog posts is to document my life so I can look
            back on my different perspectives and how they've influenced the
            graph of my life and what decisions I've made. I hope by actively
            contributing to these blog posts I can get a better understanding of
            myself and the world. My goal is to never let my priors go to zero
            and to always be constantly updating my beliefs :)

            <summary>Perfect (???) Hashing</summary>
            <div class="content">
              <p>
                I reviewed the world of hashing today and I must say that from
                the perspective of someone who is looking to improve the
                latencies of different API and backend systems getting to
                understand the mathematical frameworks that go into evaluating
                different hashing strategies was fascinating. Hashing deals with
                trying to reduce the asymptotic runtime of an abstract data type
                that can:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Insert</li>
                <li>Search</li>
                <li>Delete</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                items. We can imagine that the simplest way to do this would be
                just to allocate an array given some bound on the range of
                numbers that we are expecting to store and then just store the
                values inside of the table at that corresponding index. However
                this is infeasible since the range of numbers can grow
                exponentially large and allocating those arrays in memory can be
                intractable. Thus, this motivates some way to maybe map the
                values that we're given to some constant space. This is where we
                get hashing.
              </p>
              <p>
                Hashing is the action of mapping some number space {0,..., n-1}
                to a smaller number space {0,..., m-1} which usually means some
                slots in a dynamically allocated array. This can be tricky for
                this reason:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The values which we are hashing could have some intrinsic
                  pattern to them (multiples or powers of 2, same value, etc...)
                  which means that they could possibly be mapped to the same
                  value in {0,..., m-1}
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                This raises the question of how can we guarantee that we
                minimize the number of collisions that happen in the table?
                Also, how do we deal with collisions when they occur? It isn't
                like we can just give up on trying to insert a value at runtime.
                This introduces the first couple of strategies that deal with
                collisions:
              </p>
              <h3>Chaining</h3>
              <p>
                Chaining is the simple strategy of just creating linked lists
                for every entry in the hash table so that if there's ever a
                collision then we can just store the value within the linked
                list by appending it. This has an obvious issue since a
                malicious adversary can just pick keys that map to the same hash
                value which creates a chain of length O(n) and thus defeats the
                purpose of the hash table in the first place since it would take
                O(n) time to search up a value in our hash table. This motivates
                some other way to deal with collisions
              </p>
              <h3>Open Addressing</h3>
              <p>
                Open addressing is the process of utilizing other empty space in
                the table to store values if they happen to collide. In order to
                do this there must be some probing sequence that effectively
                encodes some permutation of <0,..., m-1> so that every spot in
                the table is checked once. The idea is that if we see another
                element stored at some spot inside of the hash table then we
                just check the next index inside of the probing sequence at that
                index in the hash table. To search for elements we would
                calculate its probing sequence and then try and search for the
                element. If at some point we come across an empty index and we
                still haven't found the element than it is safe to assume that
                the element does not exist in the hash table. The easiest way to
                do this would be to linearly probe through the array and then
                wrap around but this creates "chains" of values within the table
                which isn't good for keys drawn from a distribution which gives
                high probability to keys bunched together or that follow some
                pattern. Another way we could design a good probing sequence is
                by using quadratic probing or picking some c_1 and c_2 such that
                h(k, i) = (h(k) + c_1i + c_2i^2) mod m. This is better but still
                creates these clumps which we would ideally want to get away
                from. The best way to approach the open addressing problem is by
                trying to get close to a uniform "spread" of the probing
                sequence. We can do this by defining two auxiliary hash
                functions h_1 and h_2. h_1 can just be our regular hash function
                but it is important that h_2 maps to a number that is coprime or
                relatively prime to m. Here is why it is important. We are
                looking to generate a probing sequence that is some permutation
                of <0,..., m-1> and this is only possible due to the coprime
                property that states that if two numbers say a, b are coprime
                than their ax = 1 mod b which means that a has a multiplicative
                inverse mod b. This means that for some c âˆˆ 0, 1,..., m-1 if we
                do ac mod b then the residuals will map to that permutation of
                <0,..., m-1>. We observe that this c is in fact i in the
                original equation so our constraints are satisfied for the
                hashing function. Open addressing, however, suffers from
                managing deletions as you can imagine that deleting an element
                would cause searching for other elements to incorrectly
                terminate thinking that the element isn't there when actually
                another element that was taking the space was just deleted. We
                can assign "tombstone" markers onto different indices within the
                table so that search can pass over them. However this limits the
                provable guarantee that the search time is O(1) and related to
                just the load factor so chaining is used often when deletions
                must be made.
              </p>
              <h3>Universal Hashing</h3>
              <p>
                Even with these two strategies because our hashing functions are
                deterministic we don't have the ability to protect against a
                malicious adversary who is looking to map our keys to similar
                values. To do this we must randomized the selection of a hash
                function from a family of hash functions that in expectation
                provide us with the simple uniform hashing assumption. A good
                hashing family would be h_{a, b}(k) = ((ak + b) mod p) mod m
                such that if we choose a in {1,..., m-1} and b in {0, 1,...,
                m-1} then we are guaranteed to get that the probability of two
                keys colliding in expectation is 1/m if the a and b are chosen
                randomly.
              </p>
              <p>
                This is both a provable and powerful result. Since we can
                guarantee that in expectation that the probability that two keys
                mapping to the same hash value is 1/m regardless of the
                distribution and sampling method that produced these keys we
                know that we can both search and delete in expected and
                amortized O(1) time.

            <summary>My goals for this semester (8/28/2024)</summary>
            <div class="content">
              <p>
                If I remember correctly I think there was some framework that I
                learned that made making goals optimal. It had some catchy
                acronym like FAIR or TIME but I think a general framework for
                measuring my work and then making some sort of quota that I need
                to fill should suffice.
              </p>
              <p>
                I think the first question is what should my goals be aimed at?
                I think at this point of my career I want to aim towards
                becoming the best engineer that I can be and that means not only
                getting exposure to more things but understanding how to solve
                problems and learn quickly in different environments. This takes
                me to my first goal:
              </p>
              <b>1) Get an A in 6.1060</b>
              <p>
                One of the classes that I'm taking this semester, 6.1060, is a
                notoriously time-intensive class and it deals with a lot of
                low-level code and infrastructure. I don't necessarily need to
                take this class as I will have the credits to graduate whether
                or not I take it, but I believe that the time that I spend
                taking this class will improve my skillset as a software
                engineer better than any other pursuit that I could do on my
                own/with other people. Approaching a topic like this is a
                monumental effort in itself and randomly walking through
                material on YouTube and GitHub might entail hundreds of wasted
                hours but learning this material in a course guarantees that my
                heuristic is optimally set by professors and TA's which
                understand the topic at a high level. If I ever want to deal
                with and completely control complex systems at some point in my
                career I think this class is necessary for me. Might as well
                take it now and strive for excellence while I'm young and able.
              </p>
              <b>2) Leetcode (>5 new problems a day)</b>
              <p>
                I think one thing I've realized about the interview process and
                software engineering is that the two are very different
                disciplines but are equally important. Without one the other
                doesn't work so it is critical to be excellent in both spheres
                to be a great engineer. As I've taken more assessments and gone
                through more interview processes I've realized that success on
                leetcode type algorithm problems is a function of solving
                similar problems as recently as possible. This essentially means
                that to prepare for interviews you want to solve as many
                leetcode problems as possible and then hope in the interview you
                come across a problem which closely matches one that you did in
                preparation for the interview. Easier said than done. This takes
                a tremendous amount of discipline and willingness to accept not
                doing things you might enjoy for a while which sucks but it's
                necessary to get an elite position.
              </p>
              <b> 3) Sleep (in bed for 8 hours a night) </b>
              <p>
                This is probably the hardest goal to meet given the amount of
                classes and work that I've cut out for myself but it is most
                likely the most important goal on this list. When deciding when
                do put for my next goal I thought of things like "maintain
                emotional health and regulate your mood better" or "stay injury
                free" but I think all of these wellness goals, while great, can
                be traced back to sleep in one way or another. If I need to
                sleep for less time than allotted so be it but I cannot allow
                myself to disregard this goal for extended periods of time (3+
                nights in a row) because that's when I encounter focus and
                emotional issues that I wouldn't otherwise have.
              </p>
              <b>
                4) Derive a suitable financial strategy given my job offers
              </b>
              <p>
                While boring I think this is a very important goal for a couple
                of reasons. <br /><br />1) It gives me peace of mind when
                spending on big ticket items (trips, security deposit for an
                apartment, etc...) and smaller stuff like going out and having
                fun which benefits my interpersonal relationships.
                <br /><br />2) Gives me full control and knowledge of my
                financial situation if there ever comes a time where things go
                awry.<br /><br />

                I think I currently lack a defined idea of what I should be
                spending on dates and fun nights out with my friends especially
                in light of potentially living with my significant other after I
                graduate which might increase costs. I also want to travel over
                this coming summer so that will have to be planned for. In
                addition, I think while I'm young and have enough capital I need
                to be making sizable and frequent risks since if the money that
                I'm willing to lose now is invested in some risky position that
                has a 10:1 payoff in a rare event will have outsized positive
                effect on my life compared to negative effect of potentially
                losing it all. For example if I invest $5,000 into a risky
                option and it pays off 5x then I end up with $25,000 that I can
                now invest into an index fund which will pay me out quite a lot
                more money over my lifetime compared to if I just had the
                $5,000. Identifying areas in the market where there is asymmetry
                is hard but I think in this era of AI there are some good plays
                to be made.
              </p>
              <b> 5) Track and plan each day </b>
              <p>
                This is difficult but I want to see if I'm able to do it. It
                would just take 10 minutes at the end of each day but I really
                want to see how I can improve my life just by measuring what I'm
                able to get done, what I think I did well and what I think I can
                do better. Hopefully through this I can track my progress
                towards my previous goals and hopefully try and achieve them. I
                wish to revisit these goals at the end of my semester and be
                happy with where I've come as a result of having these goals.

            <summary>Making my personal website (8/23/2024)</summary>
            <div class="content">
              <p>
                I guess the reason why I wanted to make a personal website
                wasn't entirely just because I thought it might be nice to have
                one. I actually think there's a genuine issue with how there
                exist multiple apps and places where we effectively host our
                personas on. Like how LinkedIn is for our "professional" side,
                Instagram/FB(if you're older) is for our "rich/successful/cool
                trips and showing off" side and Twitter/X is for more of our
                intellectual and argumentative/opinionated side. There of course
                are other examples of platforms which essentially take in
                different personas and interests but it begs the question of why
                there can't be one site or application that hosts all that we
                need?
              </p>
              <p>
                I guess the obvious answer is that the task of building such a
                website/application is such a challenge that we simply don't
                have the technology to support such an endeavor. I think the
                fact that X is currently attempting to be the "Everything app"
                confirms this belief but I can't help but theorize that it is
                just the way that we humans like to organize our different
                personas and interests into buckets. Like if I log into
                instagram I have a certain attitude and thing that I'm looking
                for compared to when, say, I log ito X or LinkedIn. Like a
                specific subconscious mindset is activated which locks me into a
                certain thought process when I enter a certain app. The
                <b>problem</b> with doing this is that I don't believe you are
                representing the full-ness of your being as a human when you
                engage with these applications. This is problematic because if
                we're not authentically representing ourselves then we leave
                connection, employment and discourse opoortunities on the table
                all of which improve the human condition.

                This is in fact why I think something like a personal website
                built from scratch is important to have. It essentially frees
                anyone from the algorithmic confines that any consumer
                application like Facebook, Instgram or Twitter tries to impose
                on you. Here I have to say that I believe Twitter does a better
                job at letting users understand
                <a href="https://github.com/twitter/the-algorithm"
                  >exactly what is in the algorithm</a
                >
                which is really cool and is why I only have Twitter (except for
                LinkedIn because I want to be employed but even Twitter is
                starting to allow the ability to post and look for jobs so I
                might delete it in the future if it is comprehensive enough).
              </p>
              <p>
                I hope the future of the website looks like something that
                accurately represents and logs my beliefs, big or small, over
                the course of some significant amount of time. If all else fails
                at least I'll have a way for people to contact me and see what
                I'm up to.
