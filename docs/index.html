                            FitLink was developed as part of MIT's annual IAP
                            "Web Lab" programming competition. This was truly my
                            first real long-term hacking experience and I went
                            really deep into full-stack development. I went into
                            the project with a very surface level understanding
                            of HTML/CSS, JavaScript and web development in
                            general and I came out of the project with the
                            ability to create any full-stack application that I
                            want. I'm proud of this project and had plans to
                            scale the platform but those plans took a backseat
                            to my baseball season and other classes.

                            fine-tune one to control their output for a specific

                            I wanted a comprehensive way to view different
                            market trends for single and grouped stocks so I
                            created a program that would run everyday and
                            capture all of the different movement patterns of
                            the different stocks in the S&P500 so I could get a
                            general understanding of what was going on in the
                            market from a statistical perspective. Obviously
                            this data is widely available on the internet but
                            what's different about this program is its
                            extensibility. I'm able to create different metrics
                            and criteria for stocks and then rank the stocks
                            against each other based on that custom criteria
                            which is something that is difficult to do on other
                            visualization and backtesting platforms.

                        these blog posts I can get a better understanding of
                        myself and the world. My goal is to never let my priors
                        go to zero and to always be constantly updating my
                        beliefs :)

                                I guess the reason why I wanted to make a
                                personal website wasn't entirely just because I
                                thought it might be nice to have one. I actually
                                think there's a genuine issue with how there
                                exist multiple apps and places where we
                                effectively host our personas on. Like how
                                LinkedIn is for our "professional" side,
                                Instagram/FB(if you're older) is for our
                                "rich/successful/cool trips and showing off"
                                side and Twitter/X is for more of our
                                intellectual and argumentative/opinionated side.
                                There of course are other examples of platforms
                                which essentially take in different personas and
                                interests but it begs the question of why there
                                can't be one site or application that hosts all
                                that we need?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I guess the obvious answer is that the task of
                                building such a website/application is such a
                                challenge that we simply don't have the
                                technology to support such an endeavor. I think
                                the fact that X is currently attempting to be
                                the "Everything app" confirms this belief but I
                                can't help but theorize that it is just the way
                                that we humans like to organize our different
                                personas and interests into buckets. Like if I
                                log into instagram I have a certain attitude and
                                thing that I'm looking for compared to when,
                                say, I log ito X or LinkedIn. Like a specific
                                subconscious mindset is activated which locks me
                                into a certain thought process when I enter a
                                certain app. The <b>problem</b> with doing this
                                is that I don't believe you are representing the
                                full-ness of your being as a human when you
                                engage with these applications. This is
                                problematic because if we're not authentically
                                representing ourselves then we leave connection,
                                employment and discourse opoortunities on the
                                table all of which improve the human condition.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This is in fact why I think something like a
                                personal website built from scratch is important
                                to have. It essentially frees anyone from the
                                algorithmic confines that any consumer
                                application like Facebook, Instgram or Twitter
                                tries to impose on you. Here I have to say that
                                I believe Twitter does a better job at letting
                                users understand

                                Twitter (except for LinkedIn because I want to
                                be employed but even Twitter is starting to
                                allow the ability to post and look for jobs so I
                                might delete it in the future if it is
                                comprehensive enough).
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I hope the future of the website looks like
                                something that accurately represents and logs my
                                beliefs, big or small, over the course of some
                                significant amount of time. If all else fails at
                                least I'll have a way for people to contact me
                                and see what I'm up to.
